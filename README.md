ANDROID MALWARE DETECTION USING GENETIC ALGORITHM BASED ON OPTIMIZED FEATURE SELECTION.
The Android Malware Detection Using Genetic SVM and ANN Algorithms Based on Optimized Feature Selection project aims to develop a robust and efficient framework for detecting malicious applications on the Android platform. As the proliferation of Android devices grows, so does the risk posed by malware, making accurate and timely detection crucial for maintaining device security and user privacy.

This project leverages a hybrid machine learning approach by combining Genetic Algorithms (GA) for optimized feature selection with powerful classification techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The genetic algorithm is employed to select the most relevant and discriminative features from a high-dimensional dataset of Android app characteristics, significantly improving detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity.

The optimized feature subset is then used to train and test both SVM and ANN classifiers to identify malware samples with high precision and recall. By integrating the strengths of these algorithms, the system aims to achieve superior detection rates compared to conventional methods, effectively distinguishing between benign and malicious applications.

The project involves:

Collecting and preprocessing Android app data, including permissions, API calls, and behavioral features.

Applying genetic algorithms to perform optimized feature selection for enhanced model performance.

Training and evaluating SVM and ANN classifiers on the selected features.

Comparing the results to determine the most effective approach for Android malware detection.

Ultimately, this project contributes to the development of advanced malware detection systems that are both accurate and scalable, helping to safeguard Android users against evolving cyber threats.
